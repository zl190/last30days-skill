## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-04

### Highlights

Instagram Reels as the 8th signal source, TikTok migrated from Apify to ScrapeCreators API, and SKILL.md quality improvements. One API key (`SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY`) now covers both TikTok and Instagram.

### Added

- Instagram Reels as 8th research source via ScrapeCreators API — keyword search, engagement metrics (views, likes, comments), spoken-word transcript extraction (`scripts/lib/instagram.py`)
- `InstagramItem` dataclass, normalization, scoring (45% relevance / 25% recency / 30% engagement), deduplication, cross-source linking, and rendering
- Instagram in SKILL.md: stats template (`📸 Instagram:`), citation priority, item format description, output footer
- URL-to-name extraction examples in SKILL.md for cleaner web source display
- `--search=instagram` flag support

### Changed

- TikTok backend migrated from Apify to ScrapeCreators API (`api.scrapecreators.com`)
- `APIFY_API_TOKEN` replaced by `SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY` in config
- SKILL.md version bumped to v2.8
- WebSearch citation instruction strengthened to prevent trailing Sources: blocks
- Security section updated: Apify → ScrapeCreators references

### Fixed

- Web stats line showing full URLs instead of plain domain names
- Trailing "Sources:" block appearing after skill invitation (WebSearch tool mandate conflict)
- Instagram/TikTok not running in web-only mode when `--search=instagram` used without Reddit/X
- `$ARGUMENTS` quoting in SKILL.md for correct flag forwarding

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-15

### Highlights

Three headline features: watchlists for always-on bots, YouTube transcripts as a 4th source, and Codex CLI compatibility. Plus bundled X search with no external CLI needed.

### Added

- Open-class skill with watchlists, briefings, and history modes (SQLite-backed, FTS5 full-text search, WAL mode) (`feat(open)`)
- YouTube as a 4th research source via yt-dlp -- search, view counts, and auto-generated transcript extraction (`feat: Add YouTube`)
- OpenAI Codex CLI compatibility -- install to `~/.agents/skills/last30days`, invoke with `$last30days` (`feat: Add Codex CLI`)
- Bundled X search -- vendored subset of Bird's Twitter GraphQL client (MIT, originally by @steipete), no external CLI needed (`v2.1: Bundle Bird X search`)
- Native web search backends: Parallel AI, Brave Search, OpenRouter/Perplexity Sonar Pro (`feat(engine)`)
- `--diagnose` flag for checking available sources and authentication status
- `--store` flag for SQLite accumulation (open variant)
- Conversational first-run experience (NUX) with dynamic source status (`feat(nux)`)

### Changed

- Smarter query construction -- strips noise words, auto-retries with shorter queries when X returns 0 results
- Two-phase search architecture -- Phase 1 discovers entities (@handles, r/subreddits), Phase 2 drills into them
- Reddit JSON enrichment -- real upvotes, comments, and upvote ratio from reddit.com/.json endpoint
- Engagement-weighted scoring: relevance 45%, recency 25%, engagement 30% (log1p dampening)
- Model auto-selection with 7-day cache and fallback chain (gpt-4.1 -> gpt-4o -> gpt-4o-mini)
- `--days=N` configurable lookback flag (thanks @jonthebeef, [#18](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill/pull/18))
- Model fallback for unverified orgs (thanks @levineam, [#16](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill/pull/16))
- Marketplace plugin support via `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (inspired by @galligan, [#1](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill/pull/1))

### Fixed

- YouTube timeout increased to 90s, Reddit 429 rate limit fail-fast
- YouTube soft date filter -- keeps evergreen content instead of filtering to 0 results
- Eager import crash in `__init__.py` that broke Codex environments
- Reddit future timeout (same pattern as YouTube timeout bug)
- Process cleanup on timeout/kill -- tracks child PIDs for clean shutdown
- Windows Unicode fix for cp1252 emoji crash (thanks @JosephOIbrahim, [#17](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill/pull/17))
- X search returning 0 results on popular topics due to over-specific queries
